## A self-using branch from the original Hyperledger Fabric Samples
We are developing our own chaincode to implement our accepted paper "ProvNet: Networked Blockchain forDecentralized Secure Provenance"
We also refer readers to the installation instructions from Hyperledger Fabric's offcial website: https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.0/getting_started.html
Please note that we are currently using the v2.0 of fabric-samples so the downloaded Binaries and Docker Images should also follow the selected version: https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.0/install.html
Also, current default branch shown on the main page of this repository is v2.0.1.
